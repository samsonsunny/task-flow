# First Launch Plan (Next Iteration)

This document captures the first‑launch experience improvements to implement in the next iteration of TaskFlow.

## Must‑Have
1. Empty state with a single clear action.
   - Add a primary CTA (e.g., "Create your first task") that focuses the inline add row.
2. Guided first task creation.
   - Provide a suggested starter task title (e.g., "Plan my week") to reduce friction.
3. Micro‑onboarding (one screen max).
   - A single modal/overlay describing the core loop: add task → set date → mark done.
4. Delightful default.
   - Seed one sample task on first launch (removable).
5. Permission timing.
   - Defer permission prompts (e.g., notifications) until the relevant feature is used.

## Premium Feel (Nice‑to‑Have)
1. First‑run animation.
   - Soft fade‑in or staggered reveal for the empty state.
2. Micro‑copy polish.
   - Replace "No Tasks" with a more premium line (e.g., "Your calm space to plan").
3. One high‑quality sample.
   - Example task with a short note to set quality expectations.

## Product/UX Decisions Needed
1. Onboarding approach.
   - Choose between tutorial overlay vs. frictionless first action.
2. Sample tasks.
   - Decide whether to show one sample task or keep the list empty.
3. First‑launch checklist.
   - Decide if a lightweight checklist should appear (e.g., "Add your first task").
